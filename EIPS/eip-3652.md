## Simple Summary

This standard defines a ERC-721 token called hierarchical token which can own other ERC-721, ERC-20, ERC-1155 and any other ownable assets.

## Abstract

This EIP-721 extension proposes to deploy Minimal Owned Proxy Contract during minting each token. Owner of the token will be able to perfrom arbitrary calls using this proxy directy.

## Motivation

Having hierarchical NFTs would allow next gen of NFT games. Imagine a hero owning a sword, with a spell applied to the sword of the hero:
```
Hero
 |
 +--- Sword
        |
        +--- Spell
```

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

- Minimal Owned Proxy contract implementation MAY be the following:

    ```solidity
    contract MinimalOwnedProxy {
        IERC721 immutable public token;
        uint256 immutable public tokenId;

        modifier onlyOwner {
            require(msg.sender == owner(), "EIP3652: access denied");
            _;
        }

        constructor(uint96 tokenId12) {
            token = msg.sender;
            tokenId = (tokenId12 << 160) | uint256(uint160(address(this)));
        }

        function owner() external view returns(address) {
            return token.ownerOf(tokenId);
        }

        function execute(address target, uint256 value, bytes memory data) external payble returns(bool, bytes memory) onlyOwner {
            return target.call{ value: value }(data);
        }
    }
    ```

- EIP-3652 based smart contracts MAY store user defined `tokenId` in highest 12 bytes and use lowest 20 bytes to store address of proxy. Function `_mint` of ERC-721 could be overriden as following:

    ```solidity
    function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal override {
        require(tokenId < (1 << 96), "EIP3652: tokenId out of range");
        MinimalOwnedProxy proxy = new MinimalOwnedProxy(uint96(tokenId));
        super._mint(to, proxy.tokenId());
    }
    ```

- EIP-3652 based smart contracts MUST implement `addressOf` function returning address by `tokenId`, it COULD be implemented as following:

    ```solidity
    function addressOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns(address) {
        require(ownerOf(tokenId), "EIP3652: address query for nonexistent token");
        return address(uint160(tokenId));
    }
    ```

## Rationale

Should be useful for NFT project.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal combines already available 721 extensions and is backwards compatible with the ERC-721 standard.

## Implementation

```
Soon ...
```

## Security Considerations
