## Abstract

This EIP defines interface allowing multiple other EIPs. This interface is designed to be used in the context of [EIP-712](./eip-712.md) and allows to define abstract operations that can be executed in behalf of signer.

## Motivation

Multiple EIPs define operations that can be executed in behalf of signer and sometime introduce method naming collision and other. For example, [EIP-2612](./eip-2612.md) defines both `permit` and `nonces` methods, but gives no clue that `nonces` is related to permit operation. In case of multiple same-level EIPs implemented within one smart contract (for example: permit, delegate, vote) it's obvious that they should use different nonces.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

- Smart contract implementing EIP-712 MUST also implement the following interface:
    ```solidity
    interface ISequentialOperations {
        /// @dev Returns next nonce for the signer in the context of the operation typehash
        /// @param typehash The operation typehash
        /// @param signer The signer address
        function operationNonces(bytes32 typehash, address signer) external view returns (uint256);

        /// @dev Increments nonce for the caller in the context of the operation typehash
        /// @param typehash The operation typehash
        /// @return success True if nonce has not been invalidated previously
        function useOperationNonce(bytes32 typehash, uint256 nonce) external;
    }

    interface IParallelOperations {
        /// @dev Returns true if the operation id was not invalidated previously
        /// @param typehash The operation typehash
        /// @param signer The signer address
        /// @param operationId The operation id
        function isOperationIdAvailable(bytes32 typehash, address signer, uint256 operationId) external view returns (bool);

        /// @dev Invalidates operation id for the caller in the context of the operation typehash
        /// @param typehash The operation typehash
        /// @param operationId The operation id
        /// @return success True if nonce has not been invalidated previously
        function useOperationId(bytes32 typehash, uint256 operationId) external;
    }
    ```
