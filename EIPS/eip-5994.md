## Abstract

"Token Pods" are smart contracts that users can opt-in to that track balance changes. This EIP defines an interface for pods. In addition, this EIP extends the [EIP-20](./eip-20.md), [EIP-721](./eip-721.md), and [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md) interfaces to add support for pods.

## Motivation

This concept of Pods allows to extend the logic of tokens in the most permissionless and risk-free way. Almost arbitrary logical extensions are possible: incentives for farmers, delegation of rights, voting, etc.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

- Pods smart contract for EIP-20 and EIP-721 tokens MUST implement interface `IPod` and MUST make sure method was called by the token Pods was designated for:
    ```solidity
    /// @title Pod interface
    interface IPod {
        /// Pod receives notifications about balance changes of participants
        /// @dev This function implementation MUST make sure `msg.sender` is designated token of this Pod
        /// @param from The address of the sender or `address(0)` if the transfer is a mint or sender is not participating in this Pod
        /// @param to The address of the recipient or `address(0)` if the transfer is a burn or recipient is not participating in this Pod
        /// @param amount The amount of tokens being transferred
        function updateBalances(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external;
    }
    ```

- Pods smart contract for EIP-1155 tokens MUST implement interface `IERC1155Pod` and MUST make sure method was called by the token Pods was designated for:
    ```solidity
    /// @title Pod interface for tokens of EIP-1155 standard
    interface IERC1155Pod {
        /// Pod receives notifications about balance changes of participants
        /// @dev This function implementation MUST make sure `msg.sender` is designated token of this Pod
        /// @dev This function implementation MUST make sure `tokenId` argument is designated token id of this Pod
        /// @param from The address of the sender or `address(0)` if the transfer is a mint or sender is not participating in this Pod
        /// @param to The address of the recipient or `address(0)` if the transfer is a burn or recipient is not participating in this Pod
        /// @param tokenId The EIP-1155 token id of the token being transferred
        /// @param amount The amount of tokens being transferred
        function updateBalances(address from, address to, uint256 amount, uint256 tokenId) external;
    }
    ```

- EIP-20 and EIP-721 tokens should implement the following interface `ITokenPods`:
    ```solidity
    interface ITokenPods {
        function hasPod(address account, address pod) external view returns(bool);
        function podsCount(address account) external view returns(uint256);
        function podAt(address account, uint256 index) external view returns(address);
        function pods(address account) external view returns(address[] memory);
        function podBalanceOf(address pod, address account) external view returns(uint256);

        function addPod(address pod) external;
        function removePod(address pod) external;
        function removeAllPods() external;
    }
    ```

- EIP-1155 tokens should implement the following interface `IERC1155Pods`:
    ```solidity
    interface IERC1155Pods {
        function hasPod(address account, address pod, uint256 id) external view returns(bool);
        function podsCount(address account, uint256 id) external view returns(uint256);
        function podAt(address account, uint256 index, uint256 id) external view returns(address);
        function pods(address account, uint256 id) external view returns(address[] memory);
        function podBalanceOf(address pod, address account, uint256 id) external view returns(uint256);

        function addPod(address pod, uint256 id) external;
        function removePod(address pod, uint256 id) external;
        function removeAllPods(uint256 id) external;
    }
    ```

- Pod SHOULD NOT try to change balances of the token it was designated for, since it would introduce reentrancy, which will not pass.

## Rationale

## Backwards Compatibility

Fully backward compatibile with ERC20 and ERC721.

## Security Considerations

Pods implementations will never block balance update, but can eat upto 200,000 gas. Number of added Pods per account is limited to some immutable value (reasonable amount taking into account max transaction gas limit).
